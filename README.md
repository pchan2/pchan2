Hi there 👋

**Presearch** is a decentralised search engine with a focus on data privacy and censorship resistance, providing fairer search results and serving not only the mainstream, but also the underserved communities.

Stats: around 250,000 daily searches and over 20,000 nodes from around the world.

Your search goes through different nodes each time to ensure your search history is hard to trace. Nodes and users are rewarded with the token PRE. Presearch doesn’t profile users, store IP addresses or geolocations; and users aren’t bombarded with ads. In the age of AI, we believe users should feel secure about their data. In terms of media exposure, Presearch has over 20,000 [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Presearch) subscribers who believe in our mission. Presearch was also featured in [PC Mag](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/dont-just-google-it-smarter-search-engines-to-try?test_uuid=03iF1uOjHbmoZSTXr58OMhT&test_variant=A).

Our target audience? Anyone with data.
